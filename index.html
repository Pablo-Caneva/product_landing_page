                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Learn about our journey and how we became a staple in the community.</p>
                    <p>My great-grandfather used to make ice cream and brought his recipe from Italy in the late 1800s. He started with a small cart on the streets of the village, offering a simple but exquisite vanilla ice cream made with the freshest ingredients. As word spread about the delicious, creamy treat, his reputation grew, and so did his business.</p>
                    <p>By the early 1900s, he had opened his first ice cream parlor, a small, charming shop that became a gathering place for locals. It wasn’t just about the ice cream; it was about bringing people together, sharing stories, and creating memories. Each generation has added its own touch, but we’ve always stayed true to his original recipes and the belief that ice cream should be made with love, passion, and the finest ingredients.</p>
                    <p>Today, we continue to honor his legacy by offering our ice cream, made with the same care and commitment to quality. Our flavors have evolved, but the heart of our business remains the same—creating moments of joy, one scoop at a time.</p>
